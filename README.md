# Machine-Learning-Challenge

Utilized two models for this assignment Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier.

The Random Forest Classifier was the more accurate model for the data given.  Numbers of accuracy here:



This would tell me for this type of data set in the future I would use Random Forest again.  If it was a different data set I would need to test between two classifications and go from there.
